Join us to hear [Phil Ewels](https://x.com/tallphil) chat with [Maxime Garcia](https://x.com/gau)
and [Franziska Bonath](https://x.com/FranBonath) about how nf-core started at the
National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) at SciLifeLab in Sweden.
We chat about how the [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek) pipeline grew alongside and eventually joined nf-core,
as well as the early days of nf-core bytesize talks and outreach organisation.
